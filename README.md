Generated from the NextJS Supabase starter.

The aim of this project is to cleanly rewrite my [open-mood-tracker](https://github.com/twaslowski/open-mood-tracker)
project in NextJS cleanly using Supabase as a backend. The point is to have a cleanly written and architected project
that I can use as reference for future projects, more so than actually building something that will be used
by millions of people.
